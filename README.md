Algorithm that visits all permutations/combinations of k object whether distinct or Non- Distinct Objects

This Algorithm Consists of following three functionality :- 

1. Algorithm that visits all permutations/combinations of k object from a set of n distinct objects, numbered 1..n. (PnCDistinct.java)
2. Algorithm that visits all permutations of n (not necessarily distinct) objects (PnCNonDistinct.java)
3. Program that visits all permutations of n distinct objects,numbered 1..n, that satisfy a given set of precedence constraints (Still working on this problem) (TopologicalPermutate.java)
    - In 3rd Functionality , i am finding permuations by approaching through topological sorting.
